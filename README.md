# MorseCoder

App translates to and from Morse Code

Makes use of a Binary Tree of nodes with character values and employs recursion for tree navigation

goals:

- update error handling events as needed/discovered
- if possible, create algorithm to buildTree() that returns tree without passing in tree as argument
- maybe add animations for more pizzazz
