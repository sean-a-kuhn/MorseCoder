# MorseCoder

App translates to and from Morse Code

Makes use of a Binary Tree of nodes with character values and employs recursion to navigate

Code has basic functionality for decoding.

goals:
-generate algorithms for encoding to Morse-> functions morseEncode() and encodeInput()
-figure out a way to build morse tree--function buildTree()--without passing in tree as argument
-continue to improve function decodeInput() handling of spaces and slashes
