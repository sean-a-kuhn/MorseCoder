# MorseCoder

App translates to and from Morse Code

Makes use of a Binary Tree of nodes with character values and employs recursion to navigate

Code has basic functionality for decoding.

Still need to generate algorithm for functions to encode user input to Morse.

Should also fix function buildTree() to not include tree as parameter, but only to return tree
