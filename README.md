# MorseCoder

App translates to and from Morse Code

Makes use of a Binary Tree of nodes with character values and employs recursion to navigate

Code has basic functionality for decoding.

goals:
-generate algorithms for encoding to Morse-> functions morseEncode() and encodeInput()
- update error handling events as needed/discovered
- if possible, create algorithm to buildTree() that returns tree without passing in tree as argument
